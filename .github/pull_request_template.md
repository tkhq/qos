## Summary & Motivation (Problem vs. Solution)

## How I Tested These Changes

## Pre merge check list

- [ ] Call out updates and breaking changes via [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- [ ] Communicate verification flow breaking changes especially thoroughly. If any of the following answers are no, then this is a verification flow breaking change:
    - Can enclaves in a previous QOS version still key forward to this new version?
    - Can previous versions of QOS verify attestations from this new version?
    - Can manifests generated by a previous version still be parsed by this one?
    - Can previous approvals still be verified against a manifest (i.e. is this a non-breaking change to the manifest signing payload)?
    - Can a previous version of QOS still perform a boot standard on an enclave of this version?
